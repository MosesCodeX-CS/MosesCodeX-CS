Hey there! 👋
Okay fine, I finally caved and wrote one of these README things. Here's the deal:

I'm Moses - the guy who fixes what breaks and builds what works
By day: ICT wizard making servers behave
By night: Coding hospital systems that don't drive doctors insane
♟️ Chess enthusiast who occasionally blunders queens

Current obsession: Building a hospital management system that actually makes sense
Secret weapon: PHP (yes, it's still cool fight me)
Spirit animal: A well-configured Ubuntu server
Hot take: Vim > everything else, and I'm tired of pretending it's not

⚡ Fun fact: I can debug Apache configs faster than I can solve chess puzzles
🎯 Life goal: Make technology that helps real people, not just impresses other devs

Building stuff that matters when the server's on fire 🔥
