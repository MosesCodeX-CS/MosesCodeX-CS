# Hey there! 👋

Okay fine, I finally caved and wrote one of these README things. Here's the deal:

**I'm Moses** - the guy who fixes what breaks and builds what works  
By day: ICT wizard making servers behave  
By night: Coding hospital systems that don't drive doctors insane  
♟️ Chess enthusiast who occasionally blunders queens (but we don't talk about that)

## 🎯 What I'm About

**Current obsession:** Building a hospital management system that actually makes sense and doesn't look like it's from 1998  
**Secret weapon:** PHP (yes, it's still cool fight me) and MySQL queries that actually work  
**Spirit animal:** A well-configured Ubuntu server that hasn't crashed in 420 days  
**Hot take:** Vim > everything else, and I'm tired of pretending it's not  
**Guilty pleasure:** Writing Bash scripts for things that definitely don't need Bash scripts

## 🏗️ What I'm Building

**🚀 HMIS Revolution** - Because hospital software shouldn't make doctors want to cry  
- Clean UI that doesn't require a PhD to navigate  
- Database design that actually makes sense  
- Real hospital workflows, not just pretty code

**🌐 IT Services Hub** - Showing the world I can make things look good too  
- Smooth animations that don't freeze your browser  
- Mobile-friendly because 2024, people!  
- "View Demo" buttons that actually work (revolutionary, I know)

## 🐧 My Linux Journey

Currently deep in the Ubuntu trenches:
- **Apache2 configs** that don't give me nightmares
- **PHP setups** that actually handle traffic
- **User permissions** because security isn't optional
- **Docker** - because everyone says I should learn it
- **Bash scripting** for automating my life away

⚡ **Fun fact:** I can debug Apache configs faster than I can solve chess puzzles  
🔥 **Another fun fact:** I once fixed a production server with just `vim` and a prayer  
🎯 **Life goal:** Make technology that helps real people, not just impresses other devs

## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools

**Backend Magic:** PHP, MySQL, Apache2  
**Frontend Finesse:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
**System Sorcery:** Ubuntu, Bash, Git, Docker (learning!)  
**Secret Weapons:** Vim with Lua, Networking knowledge, and unlimited coffee

## 🎲 Let's Connect?

I don't bite (unless you mess with my production server):
- Check out my projects below
- Open an issue if you find something broken
- Collaborate on something cool
- Or just admire my commit history 👀

*Building stuff that matters when the server's on fire 🔥*  
*"First solve the problem, then write the code" - some wise person probably*
